# Invitation for valentine's day

A playful and romantic Valentine’s Day web app built with React.
The user is asked a simple question… but saying “No” is not that easy XD 

## Preview


## Features
- Interactive “No” button that smoothly escapes the mouse (desktop only)
- Mobile-friendly responsive design
- Clean UI with animations and smooth transitions
- Conditional rendering based on user interaction
- Built with React + Vite

## Purpose
This project was created as a fun and creative way to practice React fundamentals
(state, refs, effects, conditional rendering) while delivering a playful user experience.
